My name is Christopher Ghyzel. I am a senior at the University of Georgia, and an intern at [Seller Labs](http://sellerlabs.com). 

I have been programming consistently for about 2 years now. In that time I have five programming languages, made a lot of mistakes, and enjoyed every moment of it. Everyday I improve just a little bit. They say a skill takes ten thousand hours to master - and my ultimate goal is to master the art of programming.
