My name is Christopher Ghyzel. I am currently professional services consultant at Teradata with a focus on Hadoop and Big Data. I graduated Magna Cum Laude from the University of Georgia in 2015 with a degree in Computer Science.

I don't get many chances to program at my job, so I do programming and learning recreationally. Computer Science is an enormous field with a lot explore, and I created this website to share what I'm doing or what I've learned.
