Name: Space Shooter
Author: Christopher Ghyzel

Definition of Objects:

    Ship, hero (interacts with user), bullets (player and enemy), explosions, formations create enemies

Interaction Between Game Objects:

    - Bullet blows up hero and enemy ships
    - hero and enemy ships shoot bullets
    - homing bullets track player
    - Aimed Bullets shoot straight at player
    - A variant of bullet will die to spawn more bullets
    - Bullets, hero, and enemies explode upon collision


Keeping Score:

    Players get points when they finish a formation or defeat an enemy. The points values were assigned by me base on how hard I thought each enemy/formation was.

Complexity:

    - Bullets and ships explode
    - Enemies have health bars
    - Bullets track enemies
    - Players have lives and lose the game
    - Formations and bullet patterns are hand made to be pretty and fun.

Documentation / Files:
    I guess that is this.
