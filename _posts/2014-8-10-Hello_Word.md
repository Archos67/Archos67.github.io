One thing I've wanted to do for a while now get a blog going. With this post I wanted to outline the what it is all about.

Before I get started though, I would like to thank Barry Clark for his [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) from which this blog is forked. His work helped me set this up within an hour without prior experience or knowledge.

With that out of the way lets get started.

### Goals and Purpose

The main purpose behind this blog is to work on my written communication skills, especially technical writing. 

I've been coding consistently for the past year and a half, but I rarely talk about what I code, and I've **never** written about it. This blog gives me a outlet in which to do that. Everything I'm writing being published for anyone to see is admittedly intimidating, but at the same time I hope to get some feedback to improve my writing - and perhaps even my programming skills.

Less abstractly, I want to write about programming problems I have solved from the [ICPC archives](https://icpcarchive.ecs.baylor.edu), personal projects, and some self-learning I have and plan to do. One of my main hopes is that other can learn from what I have done. 

Anyhow, that is all for this post. Thanks for reading, and stay tuned for more!
